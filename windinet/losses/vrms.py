"""
Variance-normalized RMSE (VRMS) loss.

Same metric already used for evaluation (windinet.training.vae_trainer.vrmse,
"val_vrmse" in metrics.csv), exposed here as a differentiable loss so it can
optionally be optimized directly instead of only monitored. Normalizing by
the target's own variance means a channel with small dynamic range isn't
automatically "cheap" to get right the way plain RMSE would let it be.

Expected input:
    pred, target: [B, C, T, H, W]
